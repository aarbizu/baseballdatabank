### Chadwick Baseball Databank

Forked from https://github.com/chadwickbureau/baseballdatabank, adding on some automation to spin up and load databases (mysql or postgres) with the data from the Chadwick CSV files.

## How to Use

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) if you haven't already.
   
2. Pick either MySQL or postgres. YMMV, but on my MBP the postgres image is smaller and loads faster.  Both work.

3. Change into the appropriate directory and initialize the db. E.g. for postgres, after ensuring that docker is installed and ready
   ```
   cd pg-scripts
   sh init_pg_statsdb.sh
   ```
   This will get you a running docker container named `bb-stats` by default, which is built from an image you can stop and start if you like, using the `start_db.sh` and `stop_db.sh` scripts in the same directory as the "init" command you picked.  

   You don't have to worry about the *.sql files or the run_*.sh files, as those are built into the image as some glue code to enable loading or tearing down the db

4.  Start using the dbs!  If you are familiar with databases and SQL, you can connect directly to the running images and submit queries. E.g.
    ```
    docker exec -it bb-stats /bin/bash -c "psql -U postgres stats"

    # OR for mysql

    docker exec -it bb-stats /bin/bash -c "mysql stats" 
    ```
    If you want to connect to them via python or some other means, the ports are at the default setting unless you yourself modify them:  3306 for MySQL, 5432 for postgres

## Node front end

There's a Node/TypeScript app in the `/frontend` directory

Dependencies:
```
node
npm
```
The frontend is only set up to use postgress right now, so you'll have to select that option if you want to run the frontend app to explore the db.  

### .env file

There's a .env.sample that you'll probably want to customize and save as `.env` to configure ports and db connectivity.
